sup, i’m @curiosity-not-the-rover

i’m interested in breaking stuff.

i write a lot of code, but almost none of it gets to exist on the internet because it's really bad.

i just finished my final exam for year 12!

i’m really inconsistent with my activity so collaboration is difficult. if you're interested, though, go ahead and ask lol.
